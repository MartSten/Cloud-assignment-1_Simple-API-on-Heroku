This was a project for the cloudtechnologies course at NTNU.

The application is an API that fetches some information about a github project using the github API and a user provided url.


The application is currently running on Heroku!

You can test it here: https://fierce-temple-17877.herokuapp.com/projectinfo/v1/github.com/MartSten/ob1

You can also try it on any other github repository by changing the github.com/MartSten/ob1 part of the url.
